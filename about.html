        <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Ke Zhou, the founder of <b>SHIBU INA</b>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You might notice that we spelled <i>Shiba Inu</i> wrong as <i>Shibu Ina</i>. 
          Well, that was really a mispelling at first, but then our team members
          started to fell in love with such an illusional contrast. So we decided
          to use that as our company's name. What a beautiful mistake, isn't it?
        </p>
        <p>
          To be honest, the company was first initiated as nothing but
          a university project. It was not until the first subscription 
          email have we realized that this whole idea could become a real thing! 
          Therefore, my crew and I worked days and nights building our product, 
          network, and customer base.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, as of 2022, we have accumulated more than <b>2 million</b> 
          subscriotions. Meanwhile, we have recieved our first round of financing 
          from <b><a class='' src=''>Shiba Token</a></b>. In the near 
          future, we will spare no efforts to come up with more functionalities 
          for our product, so as to provide a better experience for all our beloved 
          customers.
